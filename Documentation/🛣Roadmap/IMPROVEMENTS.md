| # | Improvement | Category | Effort (S/M/L) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Take `apk-plugin-health` from the runner (one-line bin over `apk_plugin_runner::health_check()`) — Waiting on PODS/POD.THICK/DISCOVERY.Engine (handoff filed) | Coupling & Cohesion | S | `SRC/Cargo.toml` `[[bin]] apk-plugin-health` |
| 2 | Build the image from this repository alone — Needs owner: publish an SDK tag carrying `apk_plugin_runner::jobs` and push DATATYPE.wireless.CSV (the kernel rev); then drop the COPYs and `--config` patches | Coupling & Cohesion | S | `Docker/Dockerfile` |
