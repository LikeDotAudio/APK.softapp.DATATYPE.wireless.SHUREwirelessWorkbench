# Delivery — DATATYPE.wireless.SHUREwirelessWorkbench

← [Wiki home](../README.md)

The importer ships compiled into the orchestrator, and as a worker image of its own:

| What | Built by | Lands |
|---|---|---|
| `wwb_importer.rs` | `MANAGEMENT.DataMigration` (`apkaudio-data-migration`) compiles it by `#[path]`; `oaRustCore` re-exports that crate as `data_migration`; `apkaudio-orchestrator` links it. `NODE.BareMetal/Docker/Dockerfile` copies `PODS/POD.THIN/Softapps` so the path resolves in the image. | the **Node-BareMetal** container (`node-baremetal:local`); after an edit, rebuild that stack (`MANAGER.Docktor/K8/up-stack.sh NODE.BareMetal`). The daemon that feeds it a `raw_blob` as bytes is in the same image (`ORCHESTRATOR:hunter:VISA/src/services/data_migration.rs`). |
| `IMPORT:file:SHOW/Entry.py` | nothing builds it; it is loaded by file path | read by `test_handler_status.py` |
| the files | `PODS/POD.THIN/Softapps` copied into **WEB.Frontend-Assets**; the monorepo's FTPS job uploads the checkout to apk.audio | nothing opens them there |
| `SRC/` + `wwb_importer.rs` | `Docker/Dockerfile`, context the repo root (it links `contracts/` and `apk-plugin-runner`); `cargo build --release --locked` | the **Worker-WIRELESS_WWB** container (`worker-wireless-wwb:local`, project `workers`, no port); after an edit, `docker compose -f PODS/POD.workers/Docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build wireless-wwb` |

Remote: `https://github.com/LikeDotAudio/APK.softapp.DATATYPE.wireless.SHUREwirelessWorkbench.git` (no workflow of its own).

**Tested:** by hand — `cargo test --lib wwb` in MANAGEMENT.DataMigration (3 passed 2026-10-30); `test_handler_status.py` for the Python edge's `STATUS`; `Entry.run_tests()` unpacks a zip through the Rust unpacker when it is installed. `.apk.scripts/smoke.py` checks only that HEAD is pushed ([SMOKE](../%F0%9F%A7%A9Manual%20and%20Artifacts/SMOKE.md)).

**Not automated:** no CI runs the tests; the Node-BareMetal rebuild is by hand; `cargo run --bin test_wwb_importer` only prints (since LOOSE-datatype-datatype-wireless the importer publishes nothing).
